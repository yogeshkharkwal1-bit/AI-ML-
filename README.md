## 📌 AI & Machine Learning – Concepts & Practice Repository 🤖📊

Welcome to my **AI & Machine Learning practice repository**!
This repo contains **hands-on implementations of core ML algorithms**, focusing on **concept clarity, math intuition, and practical coding** using Python.

I am building this repository step-by-step as part of my **AI/ML learning journey**, starting from fundamentals and gradually moving toward advanced models.
